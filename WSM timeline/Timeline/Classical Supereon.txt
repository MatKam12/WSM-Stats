This is a long project I wanted to show you guys the first part of it, get your feedback and ideas to improve the overall quality. Let me know what do you think about the periods I have chosen here, I will be responding to constructive arguments and ideas of how to improve the project, I will not respond to any hate. I won't be asking for the names of the Eras and as of right now I will not take any ideas from you guys when it comes to the naming. I'm already working on the second part of the timeline and I'm basically finished with it it will cover years from 1983 to 1994, I have come up with the names for the Eras for this time span, what I need to do is add more stats and polish up the thing. After that, I will post the years from 1994 to 2002 which I also have covered for the most part. In the post covering 1994-2002, I might ask you guys for some names for the next period which as of right now I'm not sure how long will be, it will start in 2002 and I'm currently thinking when it should end. After everything will be finished and the full timeline will be finished I will post it as a single post. The final post will probably have some tweaks and changes to it, and it will have even more in-depth stats and information about records in stats and stuff like that, but the foundations will stay the same. I will not post the second part this month as I'm leaving for the next 3 weeks and will have very limited time and access to my workspace. All things aside I hope that at least some of you will like it, and please moderator don't delete this post haha

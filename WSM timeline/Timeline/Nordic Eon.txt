		- every nordic country aside from Denmark has a athlete that wins a title
		- out of 24 podium finishes durning those 8 years only 4 of those podium finishes weren't taken by a nordic country athlete (2nd place in 1994, 2nd place in 1995, 3rd place in 1996 and 3rd place in 1998)

			Second Great Domination Era
			Duration: 1994-1997
			Start: Magnús Ver Magnússon wins his second WSM title
			End: Magnús Ver Magnússon wins a WSM title for the 3rd time in a row
			Characteristics:
				- This is the second and last three peat in history
				- Complete domination by Magnús Ver Magnússon
					- in the span of those 3 years Magnússon won 8 out of 24 events (was tied for 1st place once) and was second 6 times, this means he either won or was a runner up more than 50% of the time. His lowest place in an event was 4th which he managed to get only 3 times. His lack of 5th place finishes indicates that he was a more complete athlete than Bill Kazmaier was durning his three peat, but the sheer amount of event won by Kazmaier proves that Magnús was not as dominant as Bill
					- in those 3 years Magnús Ver Magnússon accumulated a total of 173,5 points, the 4th most in only 3 WSM finals, he did this while having 7 events less than Kazmaier.

			Characteristics:
				- two out of  4 winners of the competition are from Finland
				- there is not a single year in which a Finn is not on a first, second, or third place 
				- in 1999 both winner and runner up are from finland

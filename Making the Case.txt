Brian Shaw

Brian Shaw... what can I say about him, that already wasn't said? What argument am I going to show you, that already wasn't made? 
What kind of stat-line am I going to show you, that already wasn't talked about? 
There is no new takes on the legacy of Brian Shaw. There is nothing new that I could tell you to convince you he is the greatest American strongman to ever show up at the WSM.
Brian's history is known to pretty much every strongman fan. From the Brian that played basketball that got invited to his first strongman comp by a friend, 
and went on to win it without a problem. To the Brian that didn't miss the WSM finals since 2009, to the brian that became one of the 3 strongman in history to win 4 WSM titles. 
To the Brian Shaw that at the age of 39, when people started to doubt if he still got what it takes, went on to get a second place finish in the Finals. 
Shaw is so good, that he is pretty much universally considered as the best American to ever put on a weighlifting belt. For some he is the greates of all time. 
For some he is an indestructible force, an Iron Man that never fails and always gets what he considers rightfully his... a title of the strongest man ever.

And thats how the argument goes. First, I tell you he has the most apperances out of any American. Than I will tell you that he never missed the finals outside of his rookie year. 
After that I will tell about his streak of 12 consecutive group wins. And finally I will tell you thay he has 4 of the hardest titles in WSM history. 
I will finish by saying that he is the G.O.A.T and that Bill Kazmaier argument is irrelevant because Bill never competed with a lineup as stacked as Brian Shaw,
and that he faced a bunch of undersized man. 

So... that's it? Right? Brian Shaw is the greates WSM athlete and it's not even a conversation to begin with...

If I follow that script bit-by-bit, we will end up with a generic Brian Shaw G.O.A.T case and nothing more than that. 
And where is the fun in that? What if I tell you than the conversation isn't as one sided as you may think? 
What if I'm going to make Brian Shaw a... human and not an unstopable force of nature from the Californian mountains?
"Hey! I thought you were suppossed to make a case for him as the greates off all time?" Yeah, yeah that is what I'm supposed to do am I. 

Don't you worry about it, I will. I just don't wanna make something that you had aleady read a houndread times. 
So, having said that, how will this look? Well, we will hit some of the same notes, see familliar landscapes, and visit a couple of known places.
So, today I will make the case for Brian Shaw, as the greates WSM competitor in history.

We start in 2008. Actually, to be more precise we start on the 13th of september 2008 in Charleston, West Virginia with WSM group 4. 
This is the debut of Brian Shaw. So how was it? Well not as glorious as you migh have imagined. He finished 3rd narrowly missing the Finals. 
Brian won 1 event, which is not that bad for a first timer. He had 21 points and thats pretty much it. That was the dabut, kind of underwhelming huh... well not really.

Shaw put up a good performance, after all he faced Laurence Shahlaei, Louis-Philippe Jean and Mariusz Pudzianowski. He wasn't a faivourite to get out of that group. 
In fact he wasn't really expected to do this good against that lineup. Regardless of that he smashed Mariusz Pudzianowski in Fingals Fingers by 10 seconds! 
Showing the world that he is a force to reckon with. After that suprisingly and from the perspective of time out of character he took last place in the Squat Lift, 
and ultimately thats what cost him his first Finals Apperance. Alright so Brian Shaw had a good start to his career, showed flashed of greatness and ultimatly overachived. 
I guess that's a good debut. But he see that every year. As a matter of guys like Bill Kazmaier, Magnus ver Magnusson or Jouko Ahola had much better debuts and we are supposed to belive thyt are not the GOATS?

It feel underwhelming to say the least. But hear me out. Wouldn't it be even more poetic if the greatest of all time wasn't a phenom from the get go?
Wouldn't it feel more like a fever dream if some mostly unknown californian not only got back to the WSM stage but amsolutely smashed it on the rout to greatness?
OK so what happaned next? While everybody were playing checkers, Brian was playing chess.

In 2009 he breazed the group taking 2nd place behind the one and only Zydrunas Savickas. Next came the Finals. He suprised everybody and smashed his first final. 
Finishing third and with one event won. Over a span of a year Brian wen't from a decend athlete to a WSM contender.
